## Features

### There is Full Functionality on the Website

- On our loading page you are presented with a home page, the header has links to register, login and after doing either one, the header changes to show, Home, Profile, or Log Out.

- After you be presented with the fully functional site ready to be used by the consumer.

- You are shown two text boxes, each one having their own function.

- The text box to the left asks you to enter a destination. For ex: Miami, FL, US. It is important to note that you may add more than one destination here and the box under the interactive map will keep score of all of the searches made by the user.

- The text box to the right asks you to enter trip duration. For ex. 9/24/23-9/29/23. There are no restrictions within this text box.  

- The other two segments of the page outside of the interactive map appear blank at first until the user has picked a location / trip duration. The block underneath the map is where all of the location selections are recorded {as mentioned above} along with the actual temperature and what it feels like. The segment to the right of the interactive map saves previous searches.
